## Introduction

**DataSmiths** is designed to streamline the process of building machine learning models by providing modular and reusable code for each step in the pipeline. This project is suitable for both beginners and experienced data scientists who want to implement predictive analytics.

## Features

- **Data Collection**: Functions to load data from various sources like CSV, Excel, and SQL databases.
- **Data Cleaning**: Methods to handle missing values, remove duplicates, and correct data errors.
- **Data Processing**: Tools for data transformation, feature engineering, and scaling.
- **Modeling**: Building, training, and evaluating machine learning models.
- **Modular Design**: Easily maintainable and extensible codebase.

## Installation

To use **DataSmiths**, clone the repository and install the required dependencies:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/DataSmiths.git
cd DataSmiths
pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage

import data_collection as dc

# Load data from a CSV file
csv_data = dc.load_csv('Dataset.csv')

# Load data from an Excel file
excel_data = dc.load_excel('Book1.xlsx', sheet_name='Sheet1')

# Load data from a SQL database
sql_data = dc.load_sql('sqlite:///path_to_your_db.db', 'SELECT * FROM my_table')

## Data Report

import data_report as dr

# Generate data report for a CSV file
dr.generate_data_report('Dataset.csv')

## Data Processing

import data_processing as dp

# Clean and transform the selected dataset
cleaned_data = dp.clean_data(selected_data)
transformed_data = dp.transform_data(cleaned_data)

Modules
data_collection.py: Functions for loading data from different sources.
data_report.py: Functions for generating detailed reports of the dataset.
data_processing.py: Functions for cleaning and processing the data.
main.py: Main script to run the pipeline.
